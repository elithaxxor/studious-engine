# Future Feature Ideas

1. **Automatic Format Selection**
   - Detect available video qualities and allow the user to choose preferred formats (MP4, WebM).
2. **Batch Download Queue**
   - Queue multiple video URLs for sequential downloading to avoid overwhelming the browser.
3. **Download History Panel**
   - Track completed downloads and allow re-downloading without re-parsing the webpage.
4. **Configurable Keyboard Shortcut**
   - Allow users to customize the trigger key instead of using the fixed Ctrl+L.
5. **Improved Error Reporting**
   - Provide detailed error messages and troubleshooting steps in the popup UI.
6. **FFmpeg Integration**
   - Use a WebAssembly build of ffmpeg to optionally merge downloaded HLS or DASH segments directly in the browser after download completes.
7. **Custom Save Locations**
   - Remember different folders for each site or quality level so downloads are automatically organized.
8. **Multi-browser Support**
   - Provide alternate manifests for Firefox and Edge to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

Additional possibilities include automatic subtitle fetching and a scheduled download mode to queue content during off-peak hours.
