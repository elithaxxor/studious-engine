oposed Solution: Browser Extension Using WebExtensions
Given the user’s## Features

### 2025-05-21 Major Update
- **Advanced Extraction:** Automatically captures video/media URLs from XHR/fetch requests and recursively scans iframes for embedded sources.
- **Automated Segment Merging:** In Electron, segments are downloaded and merged automatically using ffmpeg. In browser, user receives a merge command for ffmpeg.
- **UI Improvements:** Popup now has tabs for Proxy Management, Extraction Log, and Segment Merge. Extraction log displays all captured URLs and events. Segment merge UI allows one-click merging in Electron.

- Advanced Reddit DASH extraction: finds all video/audio streams, sorts by quality, and guides users to merge with ffmpeg.
- Session/cookie support for authenticated videos (background script monitors and supplies session cookies).
- Cross-browser support: Chrome and Firefox (WebExtensions API).

t in existing browsers, a browser extension using the WebExtensions API is recommended. This approach allows integration with Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, leveraging their rendering engines and download capabilities, while being platform-agnostic for Linux and macOS. The extension will enable users to download videos by detecting hover states and keyboard shortcuts, communicating between content and background scripts to manage the download process.

Architecture Components
The extension is structured into three main components, each with distinct responsibilities:

Content Script:
Role: Runs in the context of web pages, interacting with the DOM.
Responsibilities:
Supports multi-site video extraction:
- **YouTube:** Extracts downloadable MP4 streams from page scripts.
- **Vimeo:** Extracts HLS (.m3u8) playlists and downloads all segments.
- **Dailymotion:** Extracts available MP4 qualities from embedded JSON.
- **Twitch:** Attempts to extract HLS (.m3u8) playlists from scripts.
- **Generic:** Falls back to any <video> element or <source> found on the page.

Extraction logic is robust, with error handling and user notifications for each### Supported Sites

- **Reddit**: Extracts all available DASH video/audio qualities, sorts by best quality, and provides merging instructions. Handles authenticated videos using session cookies (works in Chrome and Firefox).
- **Embedded Players (JWPlayer, Brightcove, Kaltura, Wistia, Dacast)**: Attempts to extract direct video URLs by parsing player config objects in scripts. Handles common config patterns, but some custom implementations may require manual inspection or future updates.
- **Other Hard Sites**: Extraction strategies include parsing network requests, inspecting obfuscated JavaScript, and trying fallback methods (see below for countermeasures).

Detects <video> elements using document.querySelectorAll('video') and attaches mouseenter and mouseleave event listeners to track hover states.
Uses a MutationObserver to detect dynamically added videos, ensuring compatibility with single-page applications or pages with lazy-loaded content.

## Countermeasures for Download Firewalls

Some video sites deploy countermeasures to block direct downloads. This extension includes and recommends the following techniques:

- **User-Agent Spoofing**: Mimics browser or mobile user-agents when fetching video segments.
- **Referer Spoofing**: Sets the referer header to the video page's URL to satisfy anti-leeching checks.
- **Session Cookie Relay**: Relays session cookies from the browser to the fetch/download requests (requires permissions and user authentication).
- **CORS Bypass Hints**: Attempts to fetch resources with CORS headers, or provides instructions for using proxy tools if blocked.
- **Fallback to Blob URLs**: If direct links fail, tries to extract blob URLs (requires in-page JS execution or relay to Electron main process).
- **Dynamic Segment Assembly**: Downloads HLS/DASH segments individually and merges them locally (user provided ffmpeg guidance).
- **Network Request Monitoring**: Guides users to open DevTools and look for .mp4, .m3u8, .mpd, or segment URLs in the Network tab if automated extraction fails.

> **Practical Note:** If a direct download fails, try reloading the page, logging in, or using the extension on a different browser. For sites with aggressive anti-download measures, manual inspection or advanced proxy techniques may be required.

## Legal and Ethical Guidance

- Only download content you have the legal right to access.
- Respect site terms of service and copyright laws in your jurisdiction.
- This tool is for personal, educational, and fair-use scenarios. Commercial redistribution or circumvention of DRM is not supported.

---
Listens for keydown events to identify the keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+L), checking if the user is hovering over a video before triggering a download.
Sends messages to the background script via the messaging system when a download is requested, passing the video URL.
Background Script:
Role: Operates in the background, with access to broader browser APIs.
Responsibilities:
Listens for messages from content scripts using chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener.
Upon receiving a download request, uses the downloads.download() function to initiate the download, prompting the user to choose a save location via the saveAs: true option.
Handles errors, such as invalid URLs, by notifying the user through browser notifications or other UI feedback.
Manifest File:
Role: Defines the extension’s configuration and permissions.
Responsibilities: Specifies metadata, required permissions ("activeTab", "downloads"), content scripts to inject into web pages, and the background script. For example:
```javascript
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Video Downloader",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Download videos by hovering and pressing Ctrl+L",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "downloads"
  ],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ],
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  }
}
```


How to Use This Code
Create the Extension Folder:
Create a new directory (e.g., video-downloader).
Save the three files above (manifest.json, content.js, background.js) in this directory.
Load the Extension:
Chrome: Go to chrome://extensions/, enable "Developer mode," and click "Load unpacked." Select the folder.
Firefox: Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox, click "Load Temporary Add-on," and select any file in the folder.
Opera: Go to opera://extensions/, enable "Developer mode," and click "Load unpacked." Select the folder.
Test the Extension:
Visit a webpage with a video (e.g., a sample HTML5 video).
Hover over the video and press Ctrl+L. A download prompt should appear.
How It Works
Content Script:
Tracks hover state and video URLs.
Detects Ctrl+L and sends the video URL to the background script.
Background Script:
Receives the URL and triggers the download with a user-friendly prompt.
Manifest File:
Ties everything together, ensuring the scripts run in the correct contexts.
This extension provides a simple, effective way to download videos from any webpage, with cross-browser compatibility and support for dynamic content. Enjoy downloading your videos!
