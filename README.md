oposed Solution: Browser Extension Using WebExtensions
Given the user’s interest in existing browsers, a browser extension using the WebExtensions API is recommended. This approach allows integration with Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, leveraging their rendering engines and download capabilities, while being platform-agnostic for Linux and macOS. The extension will enable users to download videos by detecting hover states and keyboard shortcuts, communicating between content and background scripts to manage the download process.

Architecture Components
The extension is structured into three main components, each with distinct responsibilities:

Content Script:
Role: Runs in the context of web pages, interacting with the DOM.
Responsibilities:
Supports multi-site video extraction:
- **YouTube:** Extracts downloadable MP4 streams from page scripts.
- **Vimeo:** Extracts HLS (.m3u8) playlists and downloads all segments.
- **Dailymotion:** Extracts available MP4 qualities from embedded JSON.
- **Twitch:** Attempts to extract HLS (.m3u8) playlists from scripts.
- **Generic:** Falls back to any <video> element or <source> found on the page.

Extraction logic is robust, with error handling and user notifications for each supported site.

Detects <video> elements using document.querySelectorAll('video') and attaches mouseenter and mouseleave event listeners to track hover states.
Uses a MutationObserver to detect dynamically added videos, ensuring compatibility with single-page applications or pages with lazy-loaded content.
Listens for keydown events to identify the keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+L), checking if the user is hovering over a video before triggering a download.
Sends messages to the background script via the messaging system when a download is requested, passing the video URL.
Background Script:
Role: Operates in the background, with access to broader browser APIs.
Responsibilities:
Listens for messages from content scripts using chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener.
Upon receiving a download request, uses the downloads.download() function to initiate the download, prompting the user to choose a save location via the saveAs: true option.
Handles errors, such as invalid URLs, by notifying the user through browser notifications or other UI feedback.
Manifest File:
Role: Defines the extension’s configuration and permissions.
Responsibilities: Specifies metadata, required permissions ("activeTab", "downloads"), content scripts to inject into web pages, and the background script. For example:
```javascript
{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Video Downloader",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Download videos by hovering and pressing Ctrl+L",
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab",
    "downloads"
  ],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ],
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  }
}
```


How to Use This Code
Create the Extension Folder:
Create a new directory (e.g., video-downloader).
Save the three files above (manifest.json, content.js, background.js) in this directory.
Load the Extension:
Chrome: Go to chrome://extensions/, enable "Developer mode," and click "Load unpacked." Select the folder.
Firefox: Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox, click "Load Temporary Add-on," and select any file in the folder.
Opera: Go to opera://extensions/, enable "Developer mode," and click "Load unpacked." Select the folder.
Test the Extension:
Visit a webpage with a video (e.g., a sample HTML5 video).
Hover over the video and press Ctrl+L. A download prompt should appear.
How It Works
Content Script:
Tracks hover state and video URLs.
Detects Ctrl+L and sends the video URL to the background script.
Background Script:
Receives the URL and triggers the download with a user-friendly prompt.
Manifest File:
Ties everything together, ensuring the scripts run in the correct contexts.
This extension provides a simple, effective way to download videos from any webpage, with cross-browser compatibility and support for dynamic content. Enjoy downloading your videos!
